=========================
Day 0: Print Hello World! 
=========================

For this challenge, all you have to do is print the following two lines:

Hello World. 
Welcome to 30 Days of Code.

==================
Day 1: Data Types!
==================

For this challenge, consider the following inputs (you don't need to read any input):

    5.35
    'a'
    false
    100
    "I am a code monkey"
    true
    17.3
    'c'
    "derp"

For each line above, print out if it is an instance of a primitive or referenced type 
as well as which data type it is (using the typical examples above).

Note: This challenge is focused only on Java data types, but you can submit the answer 
in other languages as well. Hint: In Java, String is a referenced type. Most challenges 
in upcoming days are language-agnostic.

> Output Format

Output 9 lines. Print one line for each of the input given above in the following format:

MainDataTypeOfInstance : SpecificDataTypeOfInstance

For example, if the input is:
123

Your output should be:
Primitive : int

Make sure you spell everything correctly and capitalize your entries. Also, don't forget 
spaces and colon in between the main and specific data types! 

==================
Day 2: Arithmetic!
==================

Practice how to do arithmetic with code in this challenge! If given the meal price, 
tip percentage, and tax percentage, we can find the final price of a meal.

> Input Format

Three numbers, (M, T, and X), each on separate lines:
- M will be a double representing the original price of the meal.
- T will be a integer representing the percentage that the customer wants to tip based 
off of the original price of the meal.
- X will be an integer representing the tax percentage that the customer has to pay 
based off of the original price of the meal.

> Output Format

A string stating... "The final price of the meal is $-."

where the final price of the meal is substituted for the dash. The price should be 
rounded to the nearest integer (dollar) - the code for rounding has already been added 
in the editor if you are coding in Java.

> Sample Input

12.00
20
8

> Sample Output

The final price of the meal is $15.

> Explanation

M = 12, T = 20, X = 8
tip = (20 * 12) / 100 = 2.4
tax = (8 * 12) / 100 = 0.96
final price = 12 + 2.4 + 0.96 = 15.36
Officially, the price of the meal is $15.36, but rounded to the nearest dollar (integer), 
the meal is $15.

==========================
Day 3: If-Else Statements!
==========================

This problem will test your knowledge on "if-else" statements.

Given an integer N as input, check the following:

    If N is odd, print "Weird".
    If N is even and, in between the range of 2 and 5(inclusive), print "Not Weird".
    If N is even and, in between the range of 6 and 20(inclusive), print "Weird".
    If N is even and N>20, print "Not Weird".

We have given you partially completed code in the editor, complete it to solve the problem.

> Input Format

There is a single line of input: integer N.

> Constraints

	1 <= N <= 100

> Output Format

Print "Weird" if the number is weird. Otherwise, print "Not Weird". 
Do not print the quotation marks.

> Sample Input 1
3

> Sample Output 1
Weird

==============================================
Day 4: Logical Operators + Class vs. Instance!
==============================================

You will create a class Person and write a constructor that takes an integer, initial_Age. 
In this constructor, you should check that the initial_Age is not negative because we 
can't have people with negative ages.

If the initial_Age is negative, set the instance's age equal to zero then print:
"This person is not valid, setting age to 0."
without the quotations..

Inside of this class, you will also create an instance variable called age and if 
initial_Age is not negative, then you will set age to equal the value of initial_Age. 
In addition, you will write an instance method, amIOld(), that prints whether people 
are old or not to the console.

In amIOld(), do the following things:

    If the age of the Person instance is less than 13, then print "You are young."
    If the age of the Person instance is equal or greater than 13, but less 18, print "You are a teenager."
    Otherwise, print "You are old."

In addition, create an instance function called yearPasses() that increases the age of 
the person instance by one.

Much of the structure of the code is given to you below, but in the future, you will 
write this. The code that will create instances of your Person class is in the main 
function. You may not understand it all yet, but take a look just to see what's going on. 
Do not change any of the variable names or remove any of the code given.

> Input Format

First line contains T, number of test cases. Each test case contains an integer age, 
representing age of the person.

> Constraints

	1 <= T <=4
	-5 <= age <= 30

> Output Format

The code that will test your methods is already in the editor. All you have to do is 
edit the methods given to you in the editor so that they perform correctly as stated 
above. If your methods are implemented correctly, each testcase will print out either 
two or three lines.

If the age is less than zero, then your program should print out:

This person is not valid, setting age to 0.
You are young.
You are young.

If the age is equal or greater than 0, then your program should print out two lines. 
The first line that the program prints out should be the output of amIOld() on the 
current age. Then, three years pass via yearPasses() and the second line the program 
prints should be the output of amIOld() after the time has passed.

> Sample Input

4
-1
10
16
18

> Sample Output

This person is not valid, setting age to 0.
You are young.
You are young.

You are young.
You are a teenager.

You are a teenager.
You are old.

You are old.
You are old.

=============
Day 5: Loops!
=============

In this problem you will test your knowledge of loops. 
Given three integers a, b, and N, output the following series:

a+2^0*b, a + 2^0*b + 2^1*b, ......, a + 2^0*b + 2^1*b + ... + 2^(N-1)*b

> Input Format

The first line will contain the number of testcases T. 
Each of the next T lines will have three integers, a, b, and N.

> Constraints

	0 <= T <= 500
	0 <=a, b <= 50
	1 <= N <= 15

> Output Format

Print the answer to each test case in a separate line.

> Sample Input

2    
5 3 5
0 2 10

> Sample Output

8 14 26 50 98
2 6 14 30 62 126 254 510 1022 2046

====================
Day 6: Let's Review!
====================

Your teacher has given you the task of drawing a staircase structure. Being an expert 
programmer, you decided to make a program to draw it for you instead. Given the required 
height, can you print a staircase as shown in the example?
Note: The last line has zero spaces before it.

> Constraints

	1 <= N <= 100

> Input Format

You are given an integer N depicting the height of the staircase.

==============
Day 7: Arrays!
==============

An array is a series of elements of the same type placed in contiguous memory locations 
that can be individually referenced by adding an index to a unique identifier.

You'll be given an array of N integers, and you have to print the integers in reverse order.

> Input Format

The first line of input contains N, the number of integers. The next line contains 
N integers separated by a space.

> Constraints

	1 <= N <= 1000
	1 <= A[i] <= 10000, where A[i] is the ith integer in the array.

> Output Format

Print the N integers of the array in the reverse order on a single line separated by a space.

> Sample Input

4
1 4 3 2

> Sample Output

2 3 4 1

=============================
Day 8: Dictionaries and Maps!
=============================

You are given a phone book that consists of your friend's names and their phone number. 
After that you will be given your friend's name as query. For each query, print the 
phone number of your friend.

> Input Format

The first line will have an integer N denoting the number of entries in the phone book. 
Each entry consists of two lines: a name and the corresponding phone number.

After these, there will be some queries. Each query will contain name of a friend. 
Read the queries until end-of-file.

> Constraints

A name consists of only lower-case English letters and it may be in the format 
'first-name last-name' or in the format 'first-name'. Each phone number has exactly 
8 digits without any leading zeros.

	1 <= N <= 10^4
	1 <= queries <= 10^4

> Output Format

For each case, print "Not found" without quotes, if the friend has no entry in the phone book. 
Otherwise, print the friend's name and phone number. See sample output for the exact format.

To make the problem easier, we provided a portion of the code in the editor. You can 
either complete that code or write completely on your own.

> Sample Input

=================
Day 9: Recursion!
=================

Euclid's Algorithm for Computing the GCD of two integers

Given two integers, x and y, their GCD (greatest common divisor) can be calculated 
recursively using Euclid's Algorithm, which essentially says that if x equals y, then 
GCD(x,y)=x; otherwise, GCD(x,y)=GCD(x-y,y) if x>y. Note that this logic can be further 
optimized for a more efficient implementation.

Given the starter code in your editor, complete the function body so it returns the GCD 
of two input integers, x and y.

> Input Format

Two space-separated integers, x and y.

> Constraints

	1 <= x, y <= 10^6

> Output Format

Print the GCD of x and y as an integer.

> Sample Input

1 5

> Sample Output

For this challenge, convert a given number, n, from decimal (base 10) to binary
(base 2).

> Input Format

The first line contains a single integer, T, the number of test cases. The T
subsequent lines of test cases each contain a single value, n, the base 10
positive integer to be converted.

================================
Day 11: 2D-Arrays + More Review!
================================

Given a 6x6 2D Array, A:

1 1 1 0 0 0
0 1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0 0

We can find 16 hourglasses in A; we define an hourglass in A to be a subset of values 
with indexes falling in this pattern in A's graphical representation:

a b c
  d
e f g

The sum of an hourglass is the sum of the values within it.

Your task is to calculate the sum of every hourglass in some 2D Array, A, and print the 
largest value (maximum of the sums) as your answer.

> Input Format

There are 6 lines of input, where each line contains 6 space-separated integers describing 
2D Array A; every value in A will be in the inclusive range of -9 to 9.

> Constraints

	-9 <= A[i][j] <= 9
	0 <= i, j <= 5

> Output Format

Print the largest (maximum) hourglass sum found in A.

> Sample Input

1 1 1 0 0 0
0 1 0 0 0 0
1 1 1 0 0 0
0 0 2 4 4 0
0 0 0 2 0 0
0 0 1 2 4 0

> Sample Output

19

===================
Day 12: Inheritance
===================

You are given two classes, Student and Grade, where Student is the base class 
and Grade is the derived class. Completed code for Student and stub code for 
Grade are provided for you in the editor. Note that Grade inherits all the 
properties of Student.

Complete the Grade class by writing a class constructor (Grade(String,String,int,int)) 
and a char calculate() method. The calculate method should return the character 
representative of a Student's *Grade. Score as defined in this chart:

Score					Grade
score < 40				D
40 <= score < 60			B
60 <= score < 75			A
75 <= score < 90			E
90 <= score <= 100		O

> Input Format

Input is already handled for you by the code pre-filled in the editor. There are 
4 lines of input containing first name, last name, phone, and score, respectively.

> Constraints

	4 <= |first name|, |last name| <= 10
	phone contains exactly 7 digits
	1 <= score <= 100

> Output Format

Output is already handled for you by the code pre-filled in the editor. Your output will 
be correct if your Grade class constructor and calculate method are properly written.

> Sample Input

Heraldo
Memelli
8135627
90

> Sample Output

First Name: Heraldo
Last Name: Memelli
Phone: 8135627
Grade: O

=========================
Day 13: Abstract Classes!
=========================

In the editor we have provided the abstract Book class and a Solution class. 
In the Solution class we created instance of a class called MyBook. Your task 
is to write just the MyBook class. The class MyBook mustn't be public.

> Input Format

Input from STDIN is already handled in the code given in the editor. 
MyBook's constructor must have the following parameters: String title, 
String author, and int price.

> Output Format

The void display() method should print and label the respective title, author, and 
price of the book's instance (with each value on its own line) like so:

Title: $title
Author: $author
Price: $price

> Sample Input

The Alchemist
Paulo Coelho
248

> Sample Output

Title: The Alchemist
Author: Paulo Coelho
Price: 248

========================
Day 14: All about Scope!
========================

The absolute difference between two integers, a and b, is |a-b|. The maximum 
absolute difference of two integers in a set of positive integers, elements, 
is the largest absolute difference of any two integers in elements. The class 
Difference is started for you in the editor. It has a private instance array 
(elements) for storing N non-negative integers, and a public integer 
(maxDifference) for storing the maximum absolute difference.

Your task is to write the class constructor for Difference and the 
computeDifference method so that it finds the maximum absolute difference 
between any two numbers in N and stores it in maxDifference.

> Input Format

The first line contains a positive integer, N, denoting the size of array elements. 
The second line contains N space-separated positive integers describing elements.

> Constraints

	1 <= N <= 10
	1 <= elements[i] <= 100, where 0 <= i <= N-1

> Output Format

Print the maximum absolute difference between any two integers in elements.

> Sample Input

3
1 2 5

> Sample Output

4

> Explanation

|1-2| = 1  
|1-5| = 4  
|2-5| = 3  

We print the maximum of these absolute differences, which is 4.

====================
Day 15: Linked List!
====================

You are given a class Node in the editor which has one instance pointer 'next' 
pointing to next node and an integer data to store the data in Node. You are 
also given a pointer 'head' pointing to the head node of a linked list and an 
integer data to add to the list. Create a new node with the given integer. 
Insert this node at the tail of the linked list and return the head node. The 
given head pointer may be null, meaning that the initial list is empty.

Code for input/output is already handled in the editor. You have to complete 
the function insert given in the editor. It takes two arguments: the head node 
of the linked list and an integer data to be inserted.

> Input Format

First line contains T, the number of testcases. Each test case contains an 
integer to be inserted at tail of linked list.

> Output Format

Output the data in each node separated by space.

> Sample Input

4
2
3
4
1

> Sample Output

2 3 4 1

> Explanation

T=4
Initially head is null and 2 is inserted. 3,4,1 are inserted at the tail of linked list 
hence the linked list becomes 2 3 4 1

================
Day 16: Sorting!
================

The absolute difference between two integers, a and b, is |a-b|. The minimum 
absolute difference between two integers in a list A of positive integers, is 
the smallest absolute difference between any two integers in A.

Given a list A = {a0, a1, ..., aN-1} of unsorted integers, find and print the 
pair (or pairs) of elements having the minimum absolute difference.

Note: More than one pair of elements may have the same absolute difference.

> Input Format

The first line contains a single integer N, denoting the length of list A.
The second line contains N space-separated integers, a0, a1, ..., aN-1, 
representing the elements in A.

> Constraints

    2 <= N <= 2*10^5
    -10^7 <= A[i] <= 10^7
    A[i] != A[j], where 0 <= i < j <= N-1

> Output Format

Print the space-separated pair of elements having the minimum absolute 
difference in ascending order. If more than one pair meets this criterion, 
print them consecutively, separated by a space, in ascending order on a single 
line. Because we are printing space-separated pairs, some elements may appear 
more than once in your output.

> Sample Input 2

12
-20 -3916237 -357920 -3620601 7374819 -7330761 30 6246457 -6461594 266854 -520 -470 

> Sample Output 2

-520 -470 -20 30

> Explanation
Our minimum absolute difference is 50. The pairs (-470, -520) and (-20, 30) both have 
this difference.

===================
Day 17: Exceptions!
===================

Create a class Calculator which consists of a single method power(int,int). 
This method takes two integers, n and p, as parameters and finds np. If either 
n or p is negative, then the method must throw an exception which says 
"n and p should be non-negative".

Code for handling Input/Output is already provided in the editor. Please read 
the partially completed code in the editor and complete it.

Note: The class Calculator mustn't be public.

No need to worry about constraints, there won't be any overflow if your code 
is correct.

> Input Format

First line contains T, the number of test cases. Next T lines contain two 
integers n and p separated by a space.

> Output Format

Output T lines. For each test case if n and p are positive then print np else 
print "n and p should be non-negative" without quotes.

========================
Day 18: Queues & Stacks!
========================

A palindrome is a "word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters which reads the 
same backwards and forwards." Can you determine if a given string, s, is a palindrome?

To solve this challenge, we must first take each character in s, enqueue it in a queue, 
and also push it onto a stack. Once that's done, we must dequeue the first character 
from the queue and pop the top character off the stack, then compare the two characters 
to see if they are the same; as long as the characters match, we continue dequeueing, 
popping, and comparing each character until our containers are empty (a non-match means 
s isn't a palindrome).

Write the following four functions/methods in class Palindrome:

    void pushCharacter(char ch): Pushes a character onto a stack.
    void enqueueCharacter(char ch): Enqueues a character in a queue.
    char popCharacter(): Pops and returns the top character.
    char dequeueCharacter(): Dequeues and returns the first character.

Code handling Input/Output and determining if s is palindrome is provided in the editor.

> Input Format

A single line containing string s.

Note: s will always be lowercase.

> Output Format

If s is a palindrome, print "The word, s, is a palindrome."
Otherwise, print "The word, s, is not a palindrome." without quotes

> Sample Input

racecar

> Sample Output

The word, racecar, is a palindrome.

===================
Day 19: Interfaces!
===================

Interfaces are an important concept in Java and in a few other languages like C#.

Here you are given an interface AdvancedArithmetic which contains a method signature
int divisorSum(int n). (The divisorSum function just takes an integer as input and 
return the sum of all its divisors.) Your only task is to write a class Calculator 
which implements the interface.

Note : The class Calculator shouldn't be public.

> Input Format

Only one line containing integer n

> Constraints

	1 <= n <= 1000

> Output Format

In the first line print "I implemented: AdvancedArithmetic" without quotes. In the next 
line print the sum of divisors of n as given in problem statement.

> Sample Input

6

> Sample Output

I implemented: AdvancedArithmetic
12

> Explanation

Divisors of 6 are 1, 2, 3, and 6. (1 + 2 + 3 + 6 = 12.)

=====================================
Day 20: Review + More String Methods!
=====================================

Given a string S, find number of words in that string. For this problem a word is 
defined by a string of one or more English letters.

Note: Space or any of the special characters like ![,?.\_'@+] will act as a delimiter.

> Input Format
The string will only contain lower case english alphabets, upper case english alphabets, 
blank spaces and this special characters: ![,?.\_'@+].

> Constraints

	1 <= |S| <= 400000

> Output Format
In the first line, print number of words in the string. The words don't need to be 
unique. Also print each word in a separate line.

> Sample Input

He is a very very good boy, isn't he?

> Sample Output

10
He
is
a
very
very
good
boy
isn
t
he

================
Day 21: Generics
================

Generic methods are a very efficient way to handle multiple datatypes using a single method.

Note: Fewer languages are enabled for this challenge because the concept of Generics is not 
common in many languages.

Let's say you have an integer array and a string array. You have to write a single 
method printArray that can print all the elements of both arrays. The method should 
be able to accept both integer arrays or string arrays.

You are given code in the editor. Complete the code so that it prints the following lines:

1
2
3
Hello
World

Do not use method overloading because your answer will not be accepted.

===========================
Day 22: Binary Search Trees
===========================

The height of a binary tree is the number of nodes on the largest path from root to 
any leaf. You are given a pointer root pointing to the root of a binary search tree. 
Return the height of the tree.

You only have to complete the function getHeight given in the editor.

> Input Format

First line contains T, the number of test cases. Next T lines contain an integer data 
to be added to the binary search tree.

> Output Format

Output the height of the binary search tree.

> Sample Input

7
3
5
2
1
4
6
7

> Sample Output

4

> Explanation

The Binary Search tree formed with the given values is

      3  
     /  \
    2    5
   /    /  \
  1    4    6
             \
              7

The maximum length root to leaf path is 3->5->6->7. There are 4 nodes in this path. 
Therefore the height of the binary tree = 4.

=============================
Day 23: Review + Binary Trees
=============================

You are given a pointer root pointing to the root of a binary tree. You need to print 
the level order traversal of this tree. In level order traversal, we visit the nodes 
level by level from left to right. For example:

         3
       /   \
      5     2
     / \    /
    1   4  6

For the above tree, the level order traversal is 3 -> 5 -> 2 -> 1 -> 4 -> 6.

HINT: A queue could be helpful.

The code for input/output is already handled in the editor. You only have to complete 
the function levelOrder given in the editor. 

> Input Format

First line contains T, the number of test cases. Next T lines contain an integer data 
to be added to the binary search tree.

> Output Format

Print the values of the level order traversal separated by spaces.

> Sample Input

6
3
5
4
7
2
1

> Sample Output

3 2 5 1 4 7 

> Explanation

Level 1:        3
              /   \
Level 2:     2     5
            /     / \
Level 3:   1     4   7 

We need to print the nodes level by level. We process each level from left to right.
Level Order Traversal: 3 -> 2 -> 5 -> 1 -> 4 -> 7

========================================
Day 24: More Review + More Linked Lists!
========================================

You're given the pointer head pointing to the head node of a linked list, where the 
data in the nodes is in non decreasing order. Delete as few nodes as possible so that 
the list does not contain any value more than once. The given head pointer may be null 
indicating that the list is empty. Adjust the next pointers to ensure that the 
remaining nodes form a single sorted linked list.

The code for handling input/output is already given in the editor. You have to complete 
the function removeDuplicates given in the editor which takes one argument - the head 
of the linked list.

> Input Format

First line contains T, the number of testcases. Each test case contains an integer 
data to be inserted at tail of linked list. Note: The input data for each test case 
is always given in non-decreasing order.

> Output Format

Print the data in each node of linked list separated by a space after the deletion 
of duplicates as given in problem statement.

> Sample Input

6
1
2
2
3
3
4

> Sample Output

1 2 3 4 

> Explanation

T = 6
2 and 3 are repeated so after deleting the nodes with repeated values the linked list becomes:

1 2 3 4

===================================
Day 25: Running Time and Complexity
===================================

In this challenge, you will determine if a given number X is prime or not. A prime 
number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 
1 and itself. You will be given N numbers and for each, you will print out "Prime" 
if the number is prime or "Not prime" if the number is not prime.

If this is too easy, create a method that decides if X is prime or not in O(vX) time. 
Think modulos and square root! If you are having trouble, try creating an O(X) time 
algorithm and see whether it solves the problem or not.

> Input Format

The first line of the input is T, total number of test cases. Each of the next line 
contains an integer N.

> Constraints

    1 <= T <= 20
    1 <= N <= 2*10^9

> Output Format

For each test case print Prime if N is prime, otherwise print Not prime.

> Sample Input

3
12
5
7

> Sample Output

Not prime
Prime
Prime

> Explanation

There are three testcases 12, 5, and 7. 12 is not prime, 5 is prime, and 7 is prime.

Day 26: Testing Part I + Implementations!
=========================================

The Head Librarian at a library wants you to make a program that calculates the fine 
for returning the book after the return date. You are given the actual and the expected 
return dates. Calculate the fine as follows:

- If the book is returned on or before the expected return date, no fine will be charged, 
in other words fine is 0.
- If the book is returned in the same month as the expected return date, 
Fine = 15 Hackos × Number of late days.
- If the book is not returned in the same month but in the same year as the expected 
return date, Fine = 500 Hackos × Number of late months.
- If the book is not returned in the same year, the fine is fixed at 10000 Hackos.

> Input Format

You are given the actual and the expected return dates in D M Y format respectively. 
There are two lines of input. The first line contains the D M Y values for the actual 
return date and the next line contains the D M Y values for the expected return date.

> Output Format

Output a single value equal to the fine.

> Sample Input

9 6 2015
6 6 2015

> Sample Output

45

> Explanation

Since the actual date is 3 days later than expected, fine is calculated as 15×3=45 Hackos.

=======================
Day 27: Testing Part II
=======================

This challenge is very different from the traditional ones because it requires you to 
generate valid test cases for a problem instead of solving the problem. There are no 
sample testcases, you simply have to generate test values for the problem that satisfy 
both the problem's Input Format and the criterion laid out in the Task section.

> Problem Statement

A Discrete Mathematics professor has a class of N students. Frustrated with their lack of 
discipline, the professor decides to cancel class if fewer than K students are present when 
class starts. Given the arrival time of each student, determine if the class is canceled.

> Input Format

The first line of input contains T, the number of test cases.

Each test case spans two lines. The first has two space-separated integers, N (students 
in the class) and K (the cancelation threshold). The second contains N space-separated 
integers (a1, ..., aN) describing the students' arrival times.

Note: Non-positive arrival times (a[i]=0) indicate the student arrived early or on time; 
positive arrival times (a[i]>0) indicate the student arrived ai minutes late. If a 
student arrives exactly on time (a[i]=0), the student is considered to have entered 
before the class started.

> Output Format

For each test case, print the word YES if the class is canceled or NO if it is not, on a new line.

> Example

When properly solved, this input:

2
4 3
-1 -3 4 2
4 2
0 -1 2 1

Should produce this output:

YES
NO

For the first test case, K=3. The professor wants at least 3 students in attendance, but 
only 2 arrive on time (-3 and -1). Thus, the class is canceled.

For the second test case, K=2. The professor wants at least 2 students in attendance, 
and 2 do arrive on time (0 and -1). Thus, the class is not canceled.

> Your Task

Create and print one or more test cases for the problem above that meet the following criterion:
T <= 5
1 <= N <= 200
1 <= K <= N
-1000 <= a[i] <= 1000, where i is a member of [1, N]
The value of N should be distinct across all the test cases.
Array 'a' must have at least one zero, one positive integer, and one negative integer.

You must create five test cases to earn the maximum possible score.

The output for your test case (were it to run against a correct solution) should be:

YES
NO
YES
NO
YES

Print your test cases as output. For example:

print('1')
print('4 3')
print('-1 -3 4 2')
print('5 2')
print('0 -1 2 1 4')

> Scoring

If you submit x correct test cases, your score will be 20.0*x. If you submit more than 
5 test cases, only the first 5 test cases will be evaluated.

================================================
Day 28: RegEx, Patterns, and Intro to Databases!
================================================

RegEx helps us easily search for or match a Pattern in text. Before searching for a 
Pattern, we must specify it using some well-defined syntax.

Given a string, determine if it's a valid Pattern or not. The string may contain spaces.

Note: This is a java only challenge, a RegEx is only valid if you can compile it using 
the Pattern.compile method. You may find using a try-catch block helpful here.

> Input Format

The first line of input contains an integer, T (the number of test cases).
The T subsequent lines of test cases each contain a string of characters describing a RegEx.

> Constraints

	1 <= T <= 100

> Output Format

On a new line for each test case, print Valid if the given RegEx's syntax is correct; 
otherwise, print Invalid.

> Sample Input

3
([A-Z])(.+)
[AZ[a-z](a-z)
batcatpat(nat

> Sample Output

Valid
Invalid
Invalid

> Explanation

The second and third test cases have unbalanced brackets and will throw a 
PatternSyntaxException when compiled. For example:

[AZ[a-z](a-z) is Invalid, but [AZ[a-z](a-z)] would be Valid.
batcatpat(nat is Invalid, but batcatpat(nat) would be Valid.

=========================================
Day 29: Look at Everything We've Learned!
=========================================

Suppose you have some string S having length N that is indexed from 0 to N-1. 
You also have some string R that is the reverse of string S. S is funny if the 
condition |S[i]-S[i-1]|=|R[i]-R[i-1]| is true for every i from 1 to N-1.

Note: For some string str, str[i] denotes the ASCII value of the ith 0-indexed 
character in str. The absolute value of some integer, x, is written as |x|.

> Input Format

The first line contains an integer, T (the number of test cases).
The T subsequent lines each contain one string S.

> Constraints

	1 <= T <= 10
	2 <= length of S <= 10000

> Output Format

For each string S, print whether it is Funny or Not Funny on a new line 
(i.e.: the ith line of output should be the answer for input string Si).

> Sample Input

2
acxz
bcxz

> Sample Output

Funny
Not Funny

> Explanation

Test Case 0: S = "acxz"
|c-a| = 2 = |x-z|
|x-c| = 21 = |c-x|
|z-x| = 2 = |a-c|
We print Funny.

Test Case 1: S = "bcxz"
|c-b| = 1, but |x-z| = 2
We stop evaluating the string (as |c-b| != |x-z|), and print Not Funny.
